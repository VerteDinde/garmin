"""
This script was inspired from tmcw's Ruby script:

    https://gist.github.com/tmcw/1098861

The goal is to pretty much scrape the Garmin Connect data and post it to Twitter.
It's a little ad-hoc, considering Garmin Connect doesn't have a well-publicized
(or well-documented) API, so it requires a bit of trial-and-error to get
this to work properly. Furthermore, *it can break at any time*. Don't come crying
to me when Garmin Connect suddenly changes the API and this script doesn't work.
